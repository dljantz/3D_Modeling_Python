# 3D_Modeling_Python
My take on animating shapes in 3D space using Pygame (from scratch, no assistance from outside game engines)

I completed this project in summer / fall of 2019 as a personal challenge to see if I could create a 3D viewing experience on a 2D screen.

The only library I used was Pygame, which gave me the ability to open a new window and draw circles / lines / polygons at a particular set of 2D coordinates.
I took care of every programming / calculation necessary to correctly display a 3-dimensional array of points on the 2-dimensional screen.

To run this program, you will need to have Python and Pygame both installed on your computer. Download the code (1 file) and run it locally.
If you don't have time for that, enjoy the video tour of its functionality in this repository. The recording is also available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19N91NUr1Um6xqDU7Sqx7jJr5oUOVPViV/view?usp=sharing

To control the motion of the animation, use the keyboard arrows to move around.
Use "I" and "O" to zoom in and out.
Use "X" and "Z" to change the lens angle of the virtual camera.
Press and hold "M" for an additional fun feature.
